- **Key directories**:
  - `app/`: Next.js route handlers (`app/api`) and application pages.
  - `components/`: Reusable UI pieces such as featured property cards and skeletons.
  - `lib/`: Data-fetch helpers (e.g., Supabase client factory, fetchers) and utilities.
  - `supabase/`: SQL or Supabase function definitions and generated assets.
  - `types/`: Shared TypeScript type definitions including Supabase generated types.
  - `public/`: Static assets.
- **Backend integration**: Supabase tables/views (e.g., `listing_search`, `condominium_search`, `launch_search`) accessed via API routes.
- **Build tooling**: Next.js with Turbopack in dev, ESLint flat config, Tailwind for styling.
